<h2>The 3 movies I have watched so far in 2024</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Kung Fu Panda 4</h3>

<p>
  It was an entertained movie, but it was not as good as the other movies and
  wasted the opportunity to expand more on the adventures of Po as the "Dragon
  Warrior."
</p>

<h3>Ghoustbusters: Frozen Empire</h3>

<p>
  It was a movie that had very good visuals regarding the ghosts and the
  capturing tools, it is also in my opinion the darkest and the closest to a
  "horror" category of the franchise as it has visuals and deaths no seen before
  in the films. In other hand, the movie do not take advantage of the original
  cast of Ghoustbusters as in the final battle they do not do much.

<h3>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</h3>

<p>
  The action in this franchise do not dissapoint, it was good and it is always
  nice to see new creatures and their fighting styles. The low points are the
  special effects, even though most of the movie is CGI, it usually felt as if I
  was watching a video game and continues with Hollywood's problem of bad CGI in
  movies with a budget of $100 million plus. Another low point of the movie are
  their human characters, obviously they need to add a history to the movie to
  it can be an almost 2 hours long movie and not just 10 minutes video of
  monsters fighting. But the the important actions they did in the movie was way
  less of what they showed, as well, they are trying to "Marvelize" and going
  from serious movies to get more and more comedy in a franchise of killer
  monsters, which does not make sense.
